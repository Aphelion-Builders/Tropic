Tropic is a wgen plugin i was working for some time now and with the new jungle biomes being out i decided to complete it. So what does Tropic do? Well it generates a world that is fully covered with a thick rainforest. The Terrain has some nice hills/beaches, but also pretty high mountains. The Generator features a lot of unique BlockPopulators for a individual look:

* 3 Different, fully custom tree types featuring generated world-trees
* Lakes and small creeks
* "Glowshrooms"
* Bushes and all other foliage that can be found in minecraft
* All ores/lava/gravel/etc you need
* Custom caves
